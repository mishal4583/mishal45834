  üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've built, showcasing my ability to move from concept to deployment.

üéôÔ∏è AI-Powered Speech Recognition System
*Generative AI & FastAPI*

Engineered a robust, full-stack web application for real-time and batch speech-to-text transcription. This system integrates `faster-whisper` (a Whisper ASR model) for accurate, multilingual transcription from live microphone streams and uploaded audio files (with intelligent chunking). The application is presented within a sleek black & gold user interface.

* **Key Features:** Real-time & batch transcription, `faster-whisper` integration, multilingual support, intelligent audio chunking, FastAPI backend.

üìù AI-Powered Text Summarizer & Sentiment Analyzer
*Flask, Hugging Face Transformers & NLTK*

Developed a full-stack web application for intelligent text processing, combining abstractive summarization with sentiment analysis. This project features robust long text handling via chunking, an NLTK-based extractive fallback, and a responsive, monochromatic "glassmorphism" UI. The system is optimized for performance with model caching and asynchronous processing.

* **Key Features:** Abstractive summarization, sentiment analysis, long text handling, NLTK integration, Flask backend, asynchronous processing, model caching.

ü§ñ Mentra AI ‚Äì Personalized Learning Assistant
*Generative AI & FastAPI*

A lightweight AI assistant designed for personalized learning. This project features a fine-tuned **GPT-2** model with a **FastAPI** backend and a futuristic HTML/CSS user interface. It demonstrates my ability to enable secure, real-time prompt generation with local `.safetensors` model loading for offline, private inference.

* **Key Features:** Fine-tuned GPT-2 model, FastAPI backend, local model loading, CORS-enabled API, interactive frontend, Hugging Face Transformers integration.

üñºÔ∏è Image Generation with Pre-trained Models
*Generative AI & Flask*

A web application built with **Flask** for real-time image generation using popular **Stable Diffusion** models. This project integrates prompt-based inference with features like history tracking, asynchronous generation, and live usage statistics.

* **Key Features:** Stable Diffusion integration (Realisian, Waifu, OrangeMix), Flask backend, AJAX-based interactions, asynchronous processing, HTML/CSS UI.

üìù AI-Powered Hybrid Text Generator
*Hybrid AI & Flask*

A full-stack web app that combines traditional **Markov Chains** with **GPT-2** to generate multi-genre text. The application allows for real-time generation with output customization, interactive n-gram analysis, and a responsive **Tailwind CSS** UI.

* **Key Features:** Hybrid Markov Chain and GPT-2 models, Flask backend, async processing, model caching, JSON-based persistence, Tailwind CSS.

üèôÔ∏è Pix2Pix Image-to-Image Translation
*Computer Vision & GANs*

An implementation of a **Conditional GAN** using **U-Net** and **PatchGAN** to translate architectural maps into realistic building facades. Trained on the CMP Facades dataset, this project highlights my understanding of adversarial loss and L1 loss for image enhancement.

* **Key Features:** Conditional GAN, U-Net, PatchGAN, adversarial and L1 loss, Google Colab-based training.

üé® Neural Style Transfer Web App
*Computer Vision & Streamlit*

A user-friendly web application built with **Streamlit** for real-time style transfer. It utilizes a pre-trained stylization model from **TensorFlow Hub** to allow users to upload content and style images and download the stylized output.

* **Key Features:** Streamlit framework, TensorFlow Hub, modular API design, user uploads, downloadable outputs.
